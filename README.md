To make a website, start by opening up a blank text file from Notepad++ or Visual Studio, i preferably use Notepad++. Name the file xxx.html. You can also create a css file
for style, following the previous steps, and name it yyy.css. Lastly, you can create a javascript file, using same steps, and name it zzz.js. The created files need to be
in the same directory.

Note: all files can have different names, hence x,y,z. 

To access your newly created site, sinply paste the full path of the html file into the address bar of any web browser. 
For example if my html file is on the desktop, i would paste: C:/Users/jyao/Desktop/xxx.html into the address bar. 

Congratulations, you have created your own website. However, only people with the file(s) can access your website.
